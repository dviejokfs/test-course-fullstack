# Sum all the numbers in the array

Given an array of numbers, write a function that returns the sum of all the numbers in the array.

You need to implement the function `sum` in the file `index.ts`. This function receives an array of numbers and returns the sum of all the numbers in the array.

```typescript
function sum(numbers: number[]): number {
  // Your code here
}
```
